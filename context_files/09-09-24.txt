Flutter project kept giving package not supported error. I remembered that i upgraded all of them from command line. So there were cases that some packages were not compatible.
First i tried to downgrade flutter but it didnt work, so i went back on my git to get old versions of packages that i remembered last time they work. After flutter clean, it worked with flutter pub get.

There was an error with our technical departmant was unable to print documents that called irsaliye. After debugging current projects i noticed that my coworker committed a git that changed one of my entitites data type. After I reverted it, it worked. But then i commited that change and I change the code that entity uses. Problem was data type became non nullable to nullable so when tostring method was being used it gave no such method available. I turned them into variable.value.tostring()
