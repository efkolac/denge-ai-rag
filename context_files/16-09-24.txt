One of sales rep told me that he could not find his order in order list. When i checked DengeREP..CRM_SendXmlToLogoV2, i found out that it gave error while being processsed. error message was "120.01._7779 kodlu muhasebe hesabı bulunamadı". But its emuhacc code was "07779". Later i found out that users accounting code was changed and our company sync service was running late. when it synced problem resolved. I asked sale rep to create order again
